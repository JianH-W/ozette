Lindi is an editing shell for software development. It combines a directory
browser, a text file editor, and a command console within a tabbed window
interface modelled on pico/nano. The control keys are based on those typically
used in desktop applications, however, and not on unix shell conventions.

Global commands:
    ^Q - Quit - close all windows
    ^W - Close - close the current window
    ^? - Help - display this help text
    ^-up arrow - open the directory browser or bring it frontmost
    ^-left arrow - move to the next window leftward
    ^-right arrow - move to the next window rightward


== Directory browser

The browser tab displays a tree view of the current working directory. Use the
arrow keys to move the selection up or down, or type the name of a file or
directory to select it. Toggle a subdirectory open or closed with the space bar
or Enter key. Select a file and press Enter to open it in an editor tab.

Browser commands:
    ^O - Open - open a file in an editor window
    ^N - New - open an editor for a new, nameless file
    ^D - Directory - change the current working directory
    ^E - Execute - run some command and log output to the console
    ^F - Find - search for text across all files in the directory

== Text editor

An editor displays the contents of a single file and allows you to make changes.
Type normally to insert text at the cursor. Use the arrow keys to move the
cursor; hold down the shift key while moving the cursor to select a range of
text. Moving the cursor without holding the shift key will drop the selection.
Typing anything will replace the selection with the new text, while pressing
Backspace or Delete will remove the selected text.

Page up and page down move the cursor to the last line of the previous page or
the first line of the next page. Home and end move the cursor to the beginning
or end of the current line. 

Cut, Copy, and Paste apply to a single clipboard which is shared across all
editors. 

Editor commands:
    ^X - Cut - place selected text on the clipboard, then delete
    ^C - Copy - place selected text on the clipboard
    ^V - Paste - insert clipboard text at cursor location
    ^F - Find - move the cursor to the next occurrence of some string
    ^L - To Line - move the cursor to the beginning of the specified line
    ^S - Save - write the contents of the buffer back to disk
    ^Z - Undo - roll back the last change to the document
    ^Y - Redo - reapply the last change which was rolled back


== Shell console

The console displays output logged from commands executed against the current
directory. These may be built-in commands like Find or shell commands invoked
with Execute.

Console commands:
	^K - Kill - terminate the running command
